# Movie-To-Movie-Solver
Algorithm that uses the TMDB API to calculate all chains of length 1 and 2 for the movietomovie.com daily challenge.

This requires a TMDB API Key in order to function properly. My personal api key and login info is stored seperately in a config.py file.

*WARNING* 
Chains of length 2 and greater may take up to an hour to complete.
